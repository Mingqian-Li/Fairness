This project mainly focuses on how to improve the diabetes prediction accuracy for the minority race. 
The given features are GRS, family background and AB test results. We train a cox model based on the given data and use it to compute to compute CRS. With this CRS, we can tell who might be the potential patient.
The precondition is that we consider there is no fairness issue on GRS. GRS is just a given value for each individual. After we trained the cox model based on all data points, we have
